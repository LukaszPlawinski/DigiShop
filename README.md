The purpose of this application was to build Full Stack eCommerce  website based around business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset. 
An authentication mechanism has been set up and provide paid access to the site's data and/or other activities based on the dataset, 
such as the purchase of a product, edit profile, possibilty to check orders.

### Main Goals:
1.  By authenticating on the site and paying for some of its services, users can advance their own goals. 
    Before authenticating, the site makes it clear how those goals would be furthered by the site.
2.  The site owner is able to make money by providing this set of services to the users. 
    There is no way for a regular user to bypass the site's mechanisms and derive all of the value available to paid users without paying.

## UX
Website Is Designed for users who are looking for electronic products at a bargain price. Acces to all features such as :
Category Nav, Search bar Product list, Login, Basket is easy and intuitive. New ,lower prices are big, red and bold.
Customer can easy add products to basket however to purchase them login easy needed.
